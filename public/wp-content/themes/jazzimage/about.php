I was born in Russia, grew up in Ukraine, left my <span class="text-secondary">heart</span> in Israel, and for more than twenty years live in Amstelveen, The Netherlands.
My passion to the photography started from the magic of dad’s amateur darkroom laboratory. Old Russian enlarger, red lighting, film accessories and other aspects or printing and development, being combined with the old Russian FED camera made me <span class="text-secondary">love</span> photography for the rest of my life.

Being a big fan of the <span class="text-secondary">Jazz Music</span>, I almost found myself in a limbo – how to choose between two very different hobbies, or even life-styles: <span class="text-secondary">Jazz</span> and <span class="text-secondary">Photography</span>? This dilemma was solved from the very natural angle – I just combined these two into just one: <span class="text-secondary">Jazz Photography</span>. Being armed with Practica SLR, and later  -  several Olympus SLRs, I managed to set photo laboratory in the heart of Ukrainian Jazz life – <span class="text-secondary">first Kiev Jazz Club</span>.

Moving through cities and countries, I never forgot the <span class="text-secondary">essence</span> of the spiritual life – combined passion of <span class="text-secondary">Jazz Photo</span>. Festivals and clubs of  Israel, Netherlands, Poland, Ukraine, Belgium, Germany, USA and many other countries and places, meeting new people, new musicians, listening to the new music, building and enjoying new impressions – all these element are very essential for my life and courage, and are reflected in my <span class="text-secondary">photos</span>.
